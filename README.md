# Online-payment-fraud-detection
The main aim of the project is to detect online payment fraud using Machine Learning. This is a typical classification problem used to detect if a particular transaction is fraudulent or not.
The entire project has been coded using the Spyder IDLE.
The machine learning algorithm used here is Decision tree classifier. It is a supervised learning technique that is mostly used for Classification problems.
Python packages used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, sklearn.
